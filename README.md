# Polygon Overview

This section provides a comprehensive introduction to Polygon, its evolution, and its stack of solutions. It aims to give readers a clear understanding of what Polygon is, its strategic focus areas like Polygon 2.0, and the various components that make up its ecosystem.

## What is Polygon?

Polygon is a pioneering blockchain protocol engineered to act as a universal layer for digital value exchange. 

### Matic Network -> Polygon

Originally launched as Matic Network with the goal of scaling Ethereum through a hybrid Plasma sidechain, Polygon has undergone a transformative evolution. It has matured into a comprehensive suite of solutions designed to enhance Ethereum's scalability and versatility. This strategic transformation was a calculated move backed by extensive research and testing, all aimed at addressing the diverse needs of various use cases. In addition, the advent of zero-knowledge technology (zk-tech) marked a significant milestone, indicating that blockchains are now well-equipped to drive mass adoption.

These diverse solutions are not standalone protocols; rather, they serve as integral components of a unified Polygon protocol. The upcoming iteration of Polygon aims to further refine and seamlessly integrate these components.

- **Ethereum Synergy**: Aligns closely with Ethereum's roadmap to augment both scalability and functionality.
- **Fluid Liquidity**: Establishes a cohesive liquidity ecosystem that seamlessly integrates various Layer 2 solutions.
- **Interoperable Messaging & Composability**: Facilitates smooth communication and interaction across a diverse range of product suites and blockchain-based solutions.
- **Adaptive Modularity**: Provides a flexible architecture that allows for easy customization and future upgrades.
- **Near-Instant Transaction Finality**: Guarantees quick and reliable transaction confirmations, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Current Polygon Stack

As of today, Polygon offers a diverse range of products and solutions designed to meet various application needs. Below are the key product suites of the current Polygon stack:

### PoS

Polygon PoS serves as the backbone of Polygon's Layer 2 scaling solutions. It provides a secure and efficient platform for decentralized applications and transactions.

### zkEVM

Polygon zkEVM is Polygon's zero-knowledge-based Ethereum Virtual Machine. It aims to bring scalability and privacy to Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

### Edge

Polygon Edge provides infrastructure for application-specific chains that operate with PolyBFT consensus. They offer scalability and interoperability for decentralized applications.

### Miden

Polyvon Miden is a ZK-optimized rollup with client-side proving, aiming to complement Polygon’s set of zero-knowledge as part of the internet's value layer. Unlike many other rollups, Polygon Miden prioritizes ZK-friendliness over EVM compatibility.

### ID

Polygon ID is a decentralized identity solution that aims to provide secure and verifiable identity management on the blockchain.

These components collectively form the current stack of Polygon, each serving specific needs while contributing to the ecosystem's overall scalability, security, and interoperability.

## Proposed Polygon 2.0 Stack

### Architecture

Polygon 2.0 is designed with a multi-layered architecture to provide a comprehensive solution for scalability, security, and interoperability. The architecture is composed of four core layers:

#### 1. Staking Layer

The Staking Layer serves as the backbone of the network, providing security and consensus. It is responsible for validator management and staking operations, ensuring the overall integrity of the network.

#### 2. Interop Layer

The Interop Layer focuses on enabling seamless communication between different blockchain networks. It employs the LXLY bridge to facilitate the transfer of assets and data across multiple Layer 2 solutions and even other Layer 1 blockchains.

#### 3. Execution Layer

This layer is where all the computation takes place. It supports various execution environments like zkEVM, zk-Rollups, and more, allowing developers to choose the best fit for their applications.

#### 4. Proving Layer

The Proving Layer is responsible for generating cryptographic proofs for the executed transactions. These proofs are then verified by the Staking Layer to finalize transactions.

Together, these layers work in harmony to offer a scalable, secure, and interoperable ecosystem, pushing the boundaries of what blockchain technology can achieve.

#### Modular Design

The modular nature of Polygon 2.0 allows developers to mix and match different components from each layer, creating a tailored solution for their specific application. This modularity extends to consensus mechanisms, execution environments, and data availability options.

#### Future-Proof

Polygon 2.0 is designed to be future-proof, with the ability to integrate new technologies as they emerge. This ensures that the framework remains at the forefront of the rapidly evolving blockchain landscape.

The following diagram illustrates the various layers of Polygon 2.0.

</p>

### Governance

Polygon 2.0 introduces a forward-looking framework for decentralized governance, aiming to give the community full control over the Polygon network. This governance model is inspired by proven blockchain governance systems, particularly Ethereum's. The framework is built on three main pillars: Protocol Governance, System Smart Contracts Governance, and Community Treasury Governance.

#### Three Governance Pillars

1. **Protocol Governance**: The Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) framework serves as an open platform for the development of Polygon protocols. In Polygon 2.0, the PIP framework will cover the entire permissionless stack, allowing the community to propose and research upgrades.

2. **System Smart Contracts Governance**: This pillar focuses on the upgradeability of protocol components implemented as smart contracts. An Ecosystem Council, governed by the community, will be responsible for these upgrades. The council will operate under a tailor-made governance framework designed for secure and scalable decision-making.

3. **Community Treasury Governance**: A self-sustainable Community Treasury will be established to fund public goods and support promising ecosystem projects. The governance of this treasury will evolve from an initial board to more explicit community-driven governance mechanisms.

<img align="center" src="/static/img/readme/polygon2.0-governance-pillars.png" width="900">
</p>

#### Community Involvement

Community feedback and participation are integral to the governance process. Various channels, including forum posts and community calls, are used to gather feedback from validators, users, infrastructure providers, and dApp developers.

### Tokenomics

Polygon's native token, MATIC, has been pivotal in the network's growth since its inception in 2020. With the introduction of Polygon 2.0, a new token, **POL**, is proposed as a technical upgrade to MATIC. POL is designed to be a third-generation hyperproductive token, offering a range of utilities and incentives to its holders.

#### Key Features of POL

- **Third-Generation Token**: POL introduces the concept of hyperproductive tokens. Unlike first and second-generation tokens, POL enables its holders to validate multiple chains and assume multiple roles within those chains, thereby offering practically unlimited opportunities.

- **Major Benefits**: POL aims to provide ecosystem security, infinite scalability, and community ownership without introducing friction for users and developers.

- **Multifold Utility and Incentives**: Validators are required to stake POL to join the validator set. Once staked, they can validate any Polygon chain and establish multiple streams of incentives, including protocol rewards, transaction fees, and additional rewards.

- **Future-Proof Ecosystem**: POL will have a continuous emission to fund a Community Treasury, which will be governed by the Polygon community. This treasury will support protocol development, research, ecosystem grants, and adoption incentives.

- **Seamless Upgrade**: The transition from MATIC to POL will be facilitated through a simple technical action. Token holders will send MATIC to an upgrade smart contract, which will automatically return the equivalent amount of POL.

### Evolution of Polygon's Development Frameworks

Polygon's blockchain development framework to build sovereign blockchains have evolved significantly over time, each iteration bringing new features and capabilities. Below is a comparative table that outlines the key differences and features of Polygon Edge, Supernets, and the latest Chain Development Kit (CDK).

## State of the Docs

In sync with the ongoing advancements of Polygon 2.0, the Polygon documentation platform is also slated for significant enhancements. Originally conceived as a "Developer Hub," the platform evolved into a "Wiki" in an attempt to effectively meet the distinct needs of various projects. 

While termed a "Wiki," the platform transcends the traditional scope of a wiki, serving as more than just a repository of information. This is because it aims serve as a versatile platform that accommodates different types of technical content and the diverse needs and stages of project development.

### What to Expect?

- **Unified Experience**: Seamlessly integrated with the main Polygon website, the documentation will feature a new, dynamic learning experience. The source will maintain its independent existence for continued integrity and versatility.
- **Dynamic Documentation**: Transition from a static information repository to an interactive, dynamic knowledge platform.
- **Enhanced Learning Experience**: Intuitive and enriching content tailored to facilitate learning, whether you're a beginner or an expert.
- **User-Centric Design**: Improved information architecture and navigation, designed with different user personas in mind, all guided by principles of developer advocacy and product development.

The Polygon community is committed to offering a comprehensive and current resource that helps users stay at the cutting edge of blockchain technology. Watch this space for more updates.

## Configuration Guide

### Static-Site Generator

The [Polygon Wiki](https://wiki.polygon.technology/) is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), making it easy to serve and host its static files.

### Deployments

The deployment process for the Polygon Wiki involves two environments: **staging** and **prod**. Both environments are configured to run against the `main` branch of the repository.

Any deployment—whether to Staging or Production—requires explicit authorization from an admin of the repository.

- **Staging**: This environment is used for testing and quality assurance. Changes are deployed here first to ensure they meet the required standards before moving to Production.
- **Production**: This is the live environment accessible to the end-users. Deployments to Production are made after successful validation in the Staging environment.

### Algolia DocSearch

The documentation utilizes [Algolia's DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) to provide a powerful and user-friendly search experience. DocSearch is specifically designed to improve navigation in documentation websites, making it easier for users to find the information they need.

### Google Analytics

[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) is integrated into the platform to monitor user interactions and collect valuable data. This helps in understanding user engagement and behavior, thereby aiding in the continuous improvement of the documentation. For those curious about how data is handled, please refer to our [Terms of Use](https://polygon.technology/terms-of-use).
