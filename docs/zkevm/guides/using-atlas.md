Atlas is a 0-setup tool for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

You will need a Metamask wallet and ETH on Polygon zkEVM (testnet or mainnet) to deploy to the chain. If you need funds for testing, [check out the faucet.](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)

## How to deploy
1. Go to https://app.atlaszk.com
2. Go to the top right and change the network to Polygon zkEVM / Polygon zkEVM testnet 
3. Press Deploy

That’s it! Your contract will automatically be verified on Etherscan.

Now that you’ve got your feet wet, you can write tests for your contract, ask the ai to help you write your contracts, write deploy scripts, and more.
