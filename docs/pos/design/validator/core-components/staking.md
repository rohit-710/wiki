For Polygon Network, any participant can be qualified to become a Polygon's validator by running a full node to earn rewards and collect transaction fees. To ensure the good participation by validators, they lock up some of their MATIC tokens as a stake in the ecosystem.

Validators in Polygon Network are selected via an on-chain auction process which happens at regular intervals.

A validator has two addresses an owner address and a signer address. The staking is done with the owner address.

See also [Key Management](key-management.md).

## Stake

:::note

Currently there is limited space to accept new validators.

To join the validator set, you must submit an application through our Validator Admissions process. See: https://polygoncommunity.typeform.com/validatorshub

An approved validator can only join the active set when a currently active validator unbonds.

For more information on the current admissions process, please see: https://discourse-forum.polygon.technology/t/update-pos-validator-admissions/12344

## Unstake

Unstaking removes the validator from the active set of validators.

To ensure good participation, the validator stake is locked for 80 checkpoints.

## Restake

Validators can add more MATIC tokens to their stake:

* To earn more rewards.
* To maintain the position in the validator set.
